HTML and CSS by Oliver Hall


During week 2 of engineering, I have been tasked at creating an imitation of Instagram.com using lessons learned so far.

I have created this project folder that contains all local files, resources and images.

The project has been created using html and external css.

To access the web page, open index.html


Please note that the web page is not functioning, it is only a demonstration of css
